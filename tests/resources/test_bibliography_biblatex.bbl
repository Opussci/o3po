  We derive expressions for the probability distribution of the ratio of two
  consecutive level spacings for the classical ensembles of random matrices.
  This ratio distribution was recently introduced to study spectral properties
  of many-body problems, as, contrary to the standard level spacing
  distributions, it does not depend on the local density of states. Our
  Wigner-like surmises are shown to be very accurate when compared to numerics
  and exact calculations in the large matrix size limit. Quantitative
  improvements are found through a polynomial expansion. Examples from a
  quantum many-body lattice model and from zeros of the Riemann zeta function
  are presented.%

  According to our modal-Hamiltonian interpretation (MHI) of quantum mechanics,
  the Hamiltonian of the closed system defines the set of its definite-valued
  observables. This definition seems to be incompatible with the pointer basis
  selected by the environment-induced decoherence (EID) of the open system. In
  this paper we argue that decoherence can be understood from a closed system
  perspective which (i) shows that the incompatibility between MHI and EID is
  only apparent, and (ii) solves certain conceptual challenges that the EID

  Thermalization has been shown to occur in a number of closed quantum
  many-body systems, but the description of the actual thermalization dynamics
  is prohibitively complex. Here, we present a model - in one and two
  dimensions - for which we can analytically show that the evolution into
  thermal equilibrium is governed by a Fokker-Planck equation derived from the
  underlying quantum dynamics. Our approach does not rely on a formal
  distinction of weakly coupled bath and system degrees of freedom. The results
  show that transitions within narrow energy shells lead to a dynamics which is
  dominated by entropy and establishes detailed balance conditions that
  determine both the eventual equilibrium state and the non-equilibrium
  relaxation to it.%

  We review the theory of continuous-variable entanglement with special
  emphasis on foundational aspects, conceptual structures, and mathematical
  methods. Much attention is devoted to the discussion of separability criteria
  and entanglement properties of Gaussian states, for their great practical
  relevance in applications to quantum optics and quantum information, as well
  as for the very clean framework that they allow for the study of the
  structure of nonlocal correlations. We give a self-contained introduction to
  phase-space and symplectic methods in the study of Gaussian states of
  infinite-dimensional bosonic systems. We review the most important results on
  the separability and distillability of Gaussian states and discuss the main
  properties of bipartite entanglement. These include the extremal
  entanglement, minimal and maximal, of two-mode mixed Gaussian states, the
  ordering of two-mode Gaussian states according to different measures of
  entanglement, the unitary (reversible) localization, and the scaling of
  bipartite entanglement in multimode Gaussian states. We then discuss recent
  advances in the understanding of entanglement sharing in multimode Gaussian
  states, including the proof of the monogamy inequality of distributed
  entanglement for all Gaussian states, and its consequences for the
  characterization of multipartite entanglement. We finally review recent
  advances and discuss possible perspectives on the qualification and
  quantification of entanglement in non Gaussian states, a field of research
  that is to a large extent yet to be explored.%

  We study the "distinguishability norms" associated to either a single POVM or
  a family of POVMs. These norms quantify how quantum measurements perform in
  the task of discriminating two quantum states. We address the following
  questions regarding their behaviour in the high-dimensional regime: (i) How
  many POVMs are needed to approximate the family of all POVMs on C^d? We show
  that the answer is exp(O(d^2)). (ii) How many outcomes are required for a
  POVM to emulate the uniform POVM on C^d? Improving on previous results, we
  show that O(d^2) outcomes are necessary and sufficient. Moreover, using the
  concept of zonoid and approximation results from Banach space theory, we show
  that this property extends (in a weaker form) to an arbitrary POVM. (iii) On
  a bipartite space, what are the relative strengths of standard classes of
  locally restricted measurements? We show that the class of PPT measurements
  typically performs almost as well as the class of all measurements whereas
  restricting to separable measurements implies a substantial loss.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  In the problem of quantum state discrimination, one has to determine by
  measurements the state of a quantum system, based on the a priori side
  information that the true state is one of two given and completely known
  states, rho or sigma. In general, it is not possible to decide the identity
  of the true state with certainty, and the optimal measurement strategy
  depends on whether the two possible errors (mistaking rho for sigma, or the
  other way around) are treated as of equal importance or not. Results on the
  quantum Chernoff and Hoeffding bounds and the quantum Stein's lemma show
  that, if several copies of the system are available then the optimal error
  probabilities decay exponentially in the number of copies, and the decay rate
  is given by a certain statistical distance between rho and sigma (the
  Chernoff distance, the Hoeffding distances, and the relative entropy,
  respectively). While these results provide a complete solution to the
  asymptotic problem, they are not completely satisfying from a practical point
  of view. Indeed, in realistic scenarios one has access only to finitely many
  copies of a system, and therefore it is desirable to have bounds on the error
  probabilities for finite sample size. In this paper we provide finite-size
  bounds on the so-called Stein errors, the Chernoff errors, the Hoeffding
  errors and the mixed error probabilities related to the Chernoff and the
  Hoeffding errors.%

  We analyze equilibration times of subsystems of a larger system under a
  random total Hamiltonian, in which the basis of the Hamiltonian is drawn from
  the Haar measure. We obtain that the time of equilibration is of the order of
  the inverse of the arithmetic average of the Bohr frequencies. To compute the
  average over a random basis, we compute the inverse of a matrix of overlaps
  of operators which permute four systems. We first obtain results on such a
  matrix for a representation of an arbitrary finite group and then apply it to
  the particular representation of the permutation group under consideration.%

  We analyze the thermalization properties and the validity of the Eigenstate
  Thermalization Hypothesis in a generic class of quantum Hamiltonians where
  the quench parameter explicitly breaks a Z_2 symmetry. Natural realizations
  of such systems are given by random matrices expressed in a block form where
  the terms responsible for the quench dynamics are the off-diagonal blocks.
  Our analysis examines both dense and sparse random matrix realizations of the
  Hamiltonians and the observables. Sparse random matrices may be associated
  with local quantum Hamiltonians and they show a different spread of the
  observables on the energy eigenstates with respect to the dense ones. In
  particular, the numerical data seems to support the existence of rare states,
  i.e. states where the observables take expectation values which are different
  compared to the typical ones sampled by the micro-canonical distribution. In
  the case of sparse random matrices we also extract the finite size behavior
  of two different time scales associated with the thermalization process.%

  We prove that local random quantum circuits acting on n qubits composed of
  polynomially many nearest neighbor two-qubit gates form an approximate
  unitary poly(n)-design. Previously it was unknown whether random quantum
  circuits were a t-design for any t > 3. The proof is based on an interplay of
  techniques from quantum many-body theory, representation theory, and the
  theory of Markov chains. In particular we employ a result of Nachtergaele for
  lower bounding the spectral gap of quantum local Hamiltonians; a
  quasi-orthogonality property of permutation matrices; a result of Oliveira
  which extends to the unitary group the path-coupling method for bounding the
  mixing time of random walks; and a result of Bourgain and Gamburd showing
  that dense subgroups of the special unitary group, composed of elements with
  algebraic entries, are infinity-copy tensor-product expanders. We also
  consider pseudo-randomness properties of local random quantum circuits of
  small depth and prove they constitute a quantum poly(n)-copy tensor-product
  expander. The proof also rests on techniques from quantum many-body theory,
  in particular on the detectability lemma of Aharonov et al. We give three
  applications of the results. First we show that almost every circuit U of
  size n^k on n qubits cannot be distinguished from a Haar uniform unitary by
  circuits of size n^[(k+3)/6] that are given oracle access to U; this provides
  a data-hiding scheme against computationally bounded adversaries. Second we
  reconsider a recent argument of Masanes et al concerning local equilibration
  of time-evolving quantum systems, and strengthen the connection between fast
  equilibration of small subsystems and the circuit complexity of the
  Hamiltonian. Third we show that in one dimension almost every parallel local
  circuit of linear depth generates topological order, matching an upper bound
  to the problem due to Bravyi et al.%

  The exact solution of the two-dimensional Ising model by Onsager in 1944

  We consider the question of thermalization for isolated quantum systems after
  a sudden parameter change, a so-called quantum quench. In part icular we
  investigate the pre-requisites for thermalization focusing on the statistical
  properties of the time-averaged density matrix and o f the expectation values
  of observables in the final eigenstates. We find that eigenstates, which are
  rare compared to the typical ones sampled by the micro-canonical
  distribution, are responsible for the absence of thermalization of some
  infinite integrable models and play an important role for some non-integrable
  systems of finite size, such as the Bose-Hubbard model. We stress the
  importance of finite size effects for the thermalization of isolated quantum
  systems and discuss two alternative scenarios for thermalization, as well as
  ways to prune down the correct one.%

  According to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), even isolated
  quantum systems can thermalize because the eigenstate-to-eigenstate
  fluctuations of typical observables vanish in the limit of large systems. Of
  course, isolated systems are by nature finite, and the main way of computing
  such quantities is through numerical evaluation for finite-size systems.
  Therefore, the finite-size scaling of the fluctuations of eigenstate
  expectation values is a central aspect of the ETH. In this work, we present
  numerical evidence that for generic non-integrable systems these fluctuations
  scale with a universal power law D^-1/2 with the dimension D of the Hilbert
  space. We provide heuristic arguments, in the same spirit as the ETH, to
  explain this universal result. Our results are based on the analysis of three
  families of models, and several observables for each model. Each family
  includes integrable members, and we show how the system size where the
  universal power law becomes visible is affected by the proximity to
  integrability.%

  The anticommuting properties of fermionic operators, together with the

  composite fermionic system. Hence different points of view can give rise to
  different reasonable definitions of separable and entangled states. Here we

  Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the electron theory of metals. Among
  the substances that conduct electricity, metals occupy a special position
  because of their high conductivity. According to the generally accepted view,
  this is explained by assuming that certain small electrically charged
  particles––the electrons––are able to move from one chemical atom to
  another in the interior of metals. The chapter discusses the equations
  derived for the collective motions of the free electrons. The case in which
  separate collisions take place between the electrons and the metal atoms is
  treated in a general way; for the case in which separate collisions are not
  assumed to occur, the equations of motion are derived under special
  assumptions that are believed to correspond approximately to the conditions
  in real metals. The equations of motion are applied to stationary problems,
  and the nonstationary problems are also emphasized. The calculations of the
  absorption and emission of heat rays, in the cases considered, lead to a law
  of black-body radiation identical with that found by Lorentz. The chapter
  also examines the effects of a magnetic field.%

  We study formal properties of smooth max-information, a generalization of von
  Neumann mutual information derived from the max-relative entropy. Recent work
  suggests that it is a useful quantity in one-shot channel coding, quantum
  rate distortion theory and the physics of quantum many-body systems.
  Max-information can be defined in multiple ways. We demonstrate that
  different smoothed definitions are essentially equivalent (up to logarithmic
  terms in the smoothing parameters). These equivalence relations allow us to
  derive new chain rules for the max-information in terms of min- and
  max-entropies, thus extending the smooth entropy formalism to mutual
  information.%

  We investigate the time evolution of a generic and finite isolated quantum
  many-body system starting from a pure quantum state. We find the kinematical
  general canonical principle proposed by Popescu-Short-Winter for statistical
  mechanics can be built in a more solid ground by studying the thermalization,
  i.e. comparing the density matrices themselves rather than the measures of
  distances. In particular, this allows us to explicitly identify that, from
  any instantaneous pure state after thermalization, the state of subsystem is
  like from a microcanonical ensemble or a generalized Gibbs ensemble, but
  neither a canonical nor a thermal ones due to finite-size effect. Our results
  are expected to bring the task of characterizing the state after
  thermalization to completion. In addition, thermalization of coupled systems
  with different temperatures corresponding to mixed initial states is
  studied.%

  A reasonable physical intuition in the study of interacting quantum systems
  says that, independent of the initial state, the system will tend to
  equilibrate. In this work we study a setting where relaxation to a steady
  state is exact, namely for the Bose-Hubbard model where the system is
  quenched from a Mott quantum phase to the strong superfluid regime. We find
  that the evolving state locally relaxes to a steady state with maximum
  entropy constrained by second moments, maximizing the entanglement, to a
  state which is different from the thermal state of the new Hamiltonian.
  Remarkably, in the infinite system limit this relaxation is true for all
  large times, and no time average is necessary. For large but finite system
  size we give a time interval for which the system locally "looks relaxed" up
  to a prescribed error. Our argument includes a central limit theorem for
  harmonic systems and exploits the finite speed of sound. Additionally, we
  show that for all periodic initial configurations, reminiscent of charge
  density waves, the system relaxes locally. We sketch experimentally
  accessible signatures in optical lattices as well as implications for the
  foundations of quantum statistical mechanics.%

  We prove that quantum many-body systems on a one-dimensional lattice locally
  relax to Gaussian states under non-equilibrium dynamics generated by a
  bosonic quadratic Hamiltonian. This is true for a large class of initial
  states - pure or mixed - which have to satisfy merely weak conditions
  concerning the decay of correlations. The considered setting is a proven
  instance of a situation where dynamically evolving closed quantum systems
  locally appear as if they had truly relaxed, to maximum entropy states for
  fixed second moments. This furthers the understanding of relaxation in
  suddenly quenched quantum many-body systems. The proof features a
  non-commutative central limit theorem for non-i.i.d. random variables,
  showing convergence to Gaussian characteristic functions, giving rise to
  trace-norm closeness. We briefly relate our findings to ideas of typicality
  and concentration of measure.%

  In relativistic quantum field theory, information propagation is bounded by
  the speed of light. No such limit exists in the non-relativistic case,
  although in real physical systems, short-range interactions may be expected
  to restrict the propagation of information to finite velocities. The question
  of how fast correlations can spread in quantum many-body systems has been
  long studied. The existence of a maximal velocity, known as the Lieb-Robinson
  bound, has been shown theoretically to exist in several interacting many-body
  systems (for example, spins on a lattice)--such systems can be regarded as
  exhibiting an effective light cone that bounds the propagation speed of
  correlations. The existence of such a 'speed of light' has profound
  implications for condensed matter physics and quantum information, but has
  not been observed experimentally. Here we report the time-resolved detection
  of propagating correlations in an interacting quantum many-body system. By
  quenching a one-dimensional quantum gas in an optical lattice, we reveal how
  quasiparticle pairs transport correlations with a finite velocity across the
  system, resulting in an effective light cone for the quantum dynamics. Our
  results open perspectives for understanding the relaxation of closed quantum
  systems far from equilibrium, and for engineering the efficient quantum
  channels necessary for fast quantum computations.%

  The generalized Gibbs ensemble introduced for describing few body

  related to the nonergodic way in which operators sample, in the limit of

  \emph{analytically} to imply the equivalence with the generalized Gibbs

  The equilibration dynamics of a closed quantum system is encoded in the
  long-time distribution function of generic observables. In this paper we
  consider the Loschmidt echo generalized to finite temperature, and show that
  we can obtain an exact expression for its long-time distribution for a closed
  system described by a quantum XY chain following a sudden quench. In the
  thermodynamic limit the logarithm of the Loschmidt echo becomes normally
  distributed, whereas for small quenches in the opposite, quasi-critical
  regime, the distribution function acquires a universal double-peaked form
  indicating poor equilibration. These findings, obtained by a central limit

  Recently, there have been significant new insights concerning conditions
  under which closed systems equilibrate locally. The question if subsystems
  thermalize---if the equilibrium state is independent of the initial
  state---is however much harder to answer in general. Here, we consider a
  setting in which thermalization can be addressed: A quantum quench under a
  Hamiltonian whose spectrum is fixed and basis is drawn from the Haar measure.
  If the Fourier transform of the spectral density is small, almost all bases
  lead to local equilibration to the thermal state with infinite temperature.
  This allows us to show that, under almost all Hamiltonians that are unitarily
  equivalent to a local Hamiltonian, it takes an algebraically small time for
  subsystems to thermalize.%

  We conjecture that thermalization following a quantum quench in a strongly
  correlated quantum system is closely connected to many-body delocalization in
  the space of quasi-particles. This scenario is tested in the anisotropic
  Heisenberg spin chain with different types of integrability-breaking terms.
  We first quantify the deviations from integrability by analyzing the level
  spacing statistics and the inverse participation ratio of the system's
  eigenstates. We then focus on thermalization, by studying the dynamics after
  a sudden quench of the anisotropy parameter. Our numerical simulations
  clearly support the conjecture, as long as the integrability-breaking term
  acts homogeneously on the quasiparticle space, in such a way as to induce
  ergodicity over all the relevant Hilbert space.%

  We study a new framework for property testing of probability distributions,
  by considering distribution testing algorithms that have access to a
  conditional sampling oracle.* This is an oracle that takes as input a subset
  $S \subseteq [N]$ of the domain $[N]$ of the unknown probability distribution
  $\D$ and returns a draw from the conditional probability distribution $\D$
  restricted to $S$. This new model allows considerable flexibility in the
  design of distribution testing algorithms; in particular, testing algorithms
  in this model can be adaptive. We study a wide range of natural distribution
  testing problems in this new framework and some of its variants, giving both
  upper and lower bounds on query complexity. These problems include testing
  whether $\D$ is the uniform distribution $\calU$; testing whether $\D =
  \D^\ast$ for an explicitly provided $\D^\ast$; testing whether two unknown
  distributions $\D_1$ and $\D_2$ are equivalent; and estimating the variation
  distance between $\D$ and the uniform distribution. At a high level our main
  finding is that the new "conditional sampling" framework we consider is a
  powerful one: while all the problems mentioned above have $\Omega(\sqrt{N})$
  sample complexity in the standard model (and in some cases the complexity
  must be almost linear in $N$), we give $\poly(\log N, 1/\eps)$-query
  algorithms (and in some cases $\poly(1/\eps)$-query algorithms independent of
  $N$) for all these problems in our conditional sampling setting.
  *Independently from our work, Chakraborty et al. also considered this
  framework. We discuss their work in Subsection [1.4].%

  A sudden change of the Hamiltonian parameter drives a quantum system out of
  equilibrium. For a finite-size system, expectations of observables start
  fluctuating in time without converging to a precise limit. A new equilibrium
  state emerges only in probabilistic sense, when the probability distribution
  for the observables expectations over long times concentrate around their
  mean value. In this paper we study the full statistic of generic observables
  after a small quench. When the quench is performed around a regular (i.e.
  non-critical) point of the phase diagram, generic observables are expected to
  be characterized by Gaussian distribution functions (``good equilibration'').
  Instead, when quenching around a critical point a new universal double-peaked
  distribution function emerges for relevant perturbations. Our analytic
  predictions are numerically checked for a non-integrable extension of the
  quantum Ising model.%

  If a quantum system A, which is initially correlated to another system, E,
  undergoes an evolution separated from E, then the correlation to E generally
  decreases. Here, we study the conditions under which the correlation
  disappears (almost) completely, resulting in a decoupling of A from E. We
  give a criterion for decoupling in terms of two smooth entropies, one
  quantifying the amount of initial correlation between A and E, and the other
  characterizing the mapping that describes the evolution of A. The criterion
  applies to arbitrary such mappings in the general one-shot setting.
  Furthermore, the criterion is tight for mappings that satisfy certain natural
  conditions. Decoupling has a number of applications both in physics and
  information theory, e.g., as a building block for quantum information
  processing protocols. As an example, we give a one-shot state merging
  protocol and show that it is essentially optimal in terms of its entanglement
  consumption/production.%

  We explore the robustness of universal dynamical scaling behavior in a
  quantum system near criticality with respect to initialization in a large
  class of states with finite energy. By focusing on a homogeneous XY quantum
  spin chain in a transverse field, we characterize the non-equilibrium
  response under adiabatic and sudden quench processes originating from a pure
  as well as a mixed excited initial state, and involving either a regular
  quantum critical or a multicritical point. We find that the critical
  exponents of the ground-state quantum phase transition can be encoded in the
  dynamical scaling exponents despite the finite energy of the initial state.
  In particular, we identify conditions on the initial distribution of
  quasi-particle excitation which ensure Kibble-Zurek scaling to persist. The
  emergence of effective thermal equilibrium behavior following a sudden quench
  towards criticality is also investigated, with focus on the long-time
  dynamics of the quasi-particle excitation. For a quench to a regular quantum
  critical point, this observable is found to behave thermally provided that
  the system is prepared at sufficiently high temperature, whereas
  thermalization fails to occur in quenches taking the system towards a
  multi-critical point. We argue that the observed lack of thermalization
  originates in this case in the asymmetry of the impulse region that is also
  responsible for anomalous multicritical dynamical scaling.%

  The recent discovery that for large Hilbert spaces, almost all (that is,
  typical) Hamiltonians have eigenstates that place small subsystems in thermal
  equilibrium, has shed much light on the origins of irreversibility and
  thermalization. Here we give numerical evidence that many-body lattice
  systems generically approach typicality as the number of subsystems is
  increased, and thus provide further support for the eigenstate thermalization
  hypothesis. Our results indicate that the deviation of many-body systems from
  typicality decreases exponentially with the number of systems. Further, by
  averaging over a number of randomly-selected nearest-neighbor interactions,
  we obtain a power-law for the atypicality as a function of the Hilbert space
  dimension, distinct from the power-law possessed by random Hamiltonians.%

  We consider quantum quenches in an integrable quantum chain with tuneable
  integrability breaking interactions. In the case where these interactions are
  weak, we demonstrate that at intermediate times after the quench local
  observables relax to a prethermalized regime, which can be described by a
  density matrix that can be viewed as a deformation of a generalized Gibbs
  ensemble. We present explicit expressions for the approximately conserved
  charges characterizing this ensemble. We do not find evidence for a crossover
  from the prethermalized to a thermalized regime on the time-scales accessible
  to us. Increasing the integrability-breaking interactions leads to a
  behaviour that is compatible with eventual thermalization.%

  In this work, we show that very natural, apparently simple problems in
  quantum measurement theory can be undecidable even if their classical
  analogues are decidable. Undecidability hence appears as a genuine quantum
  property here. Formally, an undecidable problem is a decision problem for
  which one cannot construct a single algorithm that will always provide a
  correct answer in finite time. The problem we consider is to determine
  whether sequentially used identical Stern-Gerlach-type measurement devices,
  giving rise to a tree of possible outcomes, have outcomes that never occur.
  Finally, we point out implications for measurement-based quantum computing
  and studies of quantum many-body models and suggest that a plethora of
  problems may indeed be undecidable.%

  Quantum discord quantifies non-classical correlations in a quantum system
  including those not captured by entanglement. Thus, only states with zero
  discord exhibit strictly classical correlations. We prove that these states
  are negligible in the whole Hilbert space: typically a state picked out at
  random has positive discord; and, given a state with zero discord, a generic
  arbitrarily small perturbation drives it to a positive-discord state. These
  results hold for any Hilbert-space dimension, and have direct implications on
  quantum computation and on the foundations of the theory of open systems. In
  addition, we provide a simple necessary criterion for zero quantum discord.
  Finally, we show that, for almost all positive-discord states, an arbitrary
  Markovian evolution cannot lead to a sudden, permanent vanishing of discord.%

  We consider the time evolution after sudden quenches of global parameters in
  translational invariant Hamiltonians and study the time average expectation
  values and entanglement entropies in finite chains. We show that in
  noninteracting models the time average of spin correlation functions is
  asymptotically equal to the infinite time limit in the infinite chain, which
  is known to be described by a generalized Gibbs ensemble. The equivalence
  breaks down considering nonlocal operators, and we establish that this can be
  traced back to the existence of conservation laws common to the Hamiltonian
  before and after the quench. We develop a method to compute the leading
  finite-size correction for time average correlation functions and
  entanglement entropies. We find that large corrections are generally
  associated to observables with slow relaxation dynamics.%

  In the study of relaxation processes in coherent non-equilibrium dynamics of
  quenched quantum systems, ultracold atoms in optical superlattices with
  periodicity two provide a very fruitful test ground. In this work, we
  consider the dynamics of a particular, experimentally accessible initial
  state prepared in a superlattice structure evolving under a Bose-Hubbard
  Hamiltonian in the entire range of interaction strengths, further
  investigating the issues raised in Ref. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 063001
  (2008)]. We investigate the relaxation dynamics analytically in the non
  interacting and hard core bosonic limits, deriving explicit expressions for
  the dynamics of certain correlation functions, and numerically for finite
  interaction strengths using the time-dependent density-matrix renormalization
  (t-DMRG) approach. We can identify signatures of local relaxation that can be
  accessed experimentally with present technology. While the global system
  preserves the information about the initial condition, locally the system
  relaxes to the state having maximum entropy respecting the constraints of the
  initial condition. For finite interaction strengths and finite times, the
  relaxation dynamics contains signatures of the relaxation dynamics of both
  the non-interacting and hard core bosonic limits.%

  We show that macroscopic nonintegrable lattices of spins 1/2, which are often
  considered to be chaotic, do not exhibit the basic property of classical
  chaotic systems, namely, exponential sensitivity to small perturbations. We
  compare chaotic lattices of classical spins and nonintegrable lattices of
  spins 1/2 in terms of their magnetization responses to imperfect reversal of
  spin dynamics known as Loschmidt echo. In the classical case, magnetization
  exhibits exponential sensitivity to small perturbations of Loschmidt echoes,
  which is characterized by twice the value of the largest Lyapunov exponent of
  the system. In the case of spins 1/2, magnetization is only power-law
  sensitive to small perturbations. Our findings imply that it is impossible to
  define Lyapunov exponents for lattices of spins 1/2 even in the macroscopic
  limit. At the same time, the above absence of exponential sensitivity to
  small perturbations is an encouraging news for the efforts to create quantum
  simulators. The power-law sensitivity of spin 1/2 lattices to small
  perturbations is predicted to be measurable in nuclear magnetic resonance
  experiments.%

  The response of a quantum system in a pure state to an external force is
  investigated by reconsidering the standard statistical approach to quantum
  dynamics on the light of the statistical description of equilibrium based on
  typicality. We prove that the response of the large majority of quantum pure
  states subjected to the same arbitrary external perturbation tends to be
  close to the statistical response as the dimension of the Hilbert space
  increases. This is what we can term dynamical typicality. The theoretical
  analysis is substantiated by numerical simulations of the response of a spin
  system to a sudden quench of the external magnetic field. For the considered
  system we show that not only the system relaxes toward a new equilibrium
  state after the quench of the Hamiltonian but also that such a new
  equilibrium is compatible with the description of a thermal equilibrium.%

  This article summarizes the Quantum Bayesian point of view of quantum
  mechanics, with special emphasis on the view's outer edges---dubbed QBism.
  QBism has its roots in personalist Bayesian probability theory, is crucially
  dependent upon the tools of quantum information theory, and most recently,
  has set out to investigate whether the physical world might be of a type
  sketched by some false-started philosophies of 100 years ago (pragmatism,
  pluralism, nonreductionism, and meliorism). Beyond conceptual issues, work at
  Perimeter Institute is focused on the hard technical problem of finding a
  good representation of quantum mechanics purely in terms of probabilities,
  without amplitudes or Hilbert-space operators. The best candidate
  representation involves a mysterious entity called a symmetric
  informationally complete quantum measurement. Contemplation of it gives a way
  of thinking of the Born Rule as an addition to the rules of probability
  theory, applicable when an agent considers gambling on the consequences of
  his interactions with a newly recognized universal capacity: dimension
  (formerly Hilbert-space dimension). (The word "capacity" should conjure up an
  image of something like gravitational mass---a body's mass measures its
  capacity to attract other bodies. With hindsight one can say that the
  founders of quantum mechanics discovered another universal capacity,
  "dimension.") The article ends by showing that the egocentric elements in
  QBism represent no impediment to pursuing quantum cosmology and outlining
  some directions for future work.%

  We investigate the quench of half-filled 1D and 2D fermionic Hubbard models
  to models without Coulomb interaction. Since the time propagation is gaussian
  we can use a variety of time-dependent quantum Monte Carlo methods to tackle
  this problem without generating a dynamical sign problem. Using a continuous
  time quantum Monte Carlo method (CTQMC) we achieve a system size of 128 sites
  in 1D, and using a Blankenbecler-Scalapino-Sugar (BSS) type algorithm we were
  able to simulate 20 x 20 square lattices. Applying these methods to study the
  dynamics after the quench, we observe that the final state of the system can
  be reasonably well described by a thermal single-particle density matrix that
  takes the initial single particle conservation laws into account. The
  characteristic decay towards this limit is found to be oscillatory with an
  additional power law decay that depends on the dimensionality. This
  numerically exact result is shown to compare favorable to mean-field
  approximations as well as to perturbation theory. Furthermore we observe the
  information propagation in the 1D-case in the charge charge and spin spin
  correlations and find that it is linear with a velocity of roughly v = 4 in
  units of the hopping amplitude.%

  We extend the formalism of pure state thermodynamics to matrix product
  states. In pure state thermodynamics finite temperature properties of quantum
  systems are derived without the need of statistical mechanics ensembles, but
  instead using typical properties of random pure states. We show that this
  formalism can be useful from the computational point of view when combined
  with tensor network algorithms. In particular, a recently introduced Monte
  Carlo algorithm is considered which samples matrix product states at random
  for the estimation of finite temperature observables. Here we characterize
  this algorithm as an $(\epsilon, \delta)$-approximation scheme and we
  analytically show that sampling one single state is sufficient to obtain a
  very good estimation of finite temperature expectation values. These results
  provide a substantial computational improvement with respect to similar
  algorithms for one-dimensional quantum systems based on uniformly distributed
  pure states. The analytical calculations are numerically supported simulating
  finite temperature interacting spin systems of size up to 100 qubits.%

  Many applications have been found for carbon nanotubes, and we can now add a
  role as a 'nanothermometer' to this list. We describe how the height of a
  continuous, unidimensional column of liquid gallium inside a carbon nanotube
  (up to about 10 micrometres long and about 75 nanometres in diameter) varies
  linearly and reproducibly in the temperature range 50-500 degrees C, with an
  expansion coefficient that is the same as for gallium in the macroscopic
  state. We chose gallium as our thermal indicator because it has one of the
  greatest liquid ranges of any metal (29.78-2,403 degrees C) and a low vapour
  pressure even at high temperatures. This nanothermometer should be suitable
  for use in a wide variety of microenvironments.%

  Boson-Sampling is a classically computationally hard problem that can - in
  principle - be efficiently solved with quantum linear optical networks. Very
  recently, a rush of experimental activity has ignited with the aim of
  developing such devices as feasible instances of quantum simulators. Even
  approximate Boson-Sampling is believed to be hard with high probability if
  the unitary describing the optical network is drawn from the Haar measure. In
  this work we show that in this setup, with probability exponentially close to
  one in the number of bosons, no symmetric algorithm can distinguish the
  Boson-Sampling distribution from the uniform one from fewer than
  exponentially many samples. This means that the two distributions are
  operationally indistinguishable without detailed a priori knowledge. We
  carefully discuss the prospects of efficiently using knowledge about the
  implemented unitary for devising non-symmetric algorithms that could
  potentially improve upon this. We conclude that due to the very fact that
  Boson-Sampling is believed to be hard, efficient classical certification of
  Boson-Sampling devices seems to be out of reach.%

  special emphasis on the influence of the longitudinal trapping potential and
  the finite size of the system, both of which are highly relevant in
  experiments. In particular, we quantify their influence on the phase
  correlation properties and the characteristic velocity with which the

  For a system at a temperature of absolute zero, all thermal fluctuations are
  frozen out, while quantum fluctuations prevail. These microscopic quantum
  fluctuations can induce a macroscopic phase transition in the ground state of
  a many-body system when the relative strength of two competing energy terms
  is varied across a critical value. Here we observe such a quantum phase
  transition in a Bose-Einstein condensate with repulsive interactions, held in
  a three-dimensional optical lattice potential. As the potential depth of the
  lattice is increased, a transition is observed from a superfluid to a Mott
  insulator phase. In the superfluid phase, each atom is spread out over the
  entire lattice, with long-range phase coherence. But in the insulating phase,
  exact numbers of atoms are localized at individual lattice sites, with no
  phase coherence across the lattice; this phase is characterized by a gap in
  the excitation spectrum. We can induce reversible changes between the two
  ground states of the system.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  A Bose-Einstein condensate represents the most 'classical' form of a matter
  wave, just as an optical laser emits the most classical form of an
  electromagnetic wave. Nevertheless, the matter wave field has a quantized
  structure owing to the granularity of the discrete underlying atoms. Although
  such a field is usually assumed to be intrinsically stable (apart from
  incoherent loss processes), this is no longer true when the condensate is in
  a coherent superposition of different atom number states. For example, in a
  Bose-Einstein condensate confined by a three-dimensional optical lattice,
  each potential well can be prepared in a coherent superposition of different
  atom number states, with constant relative phases between neighbouring
  lattice sites. It is then natural to ask how the individual matter wave
  fields and their relative phases evolve. Here we use such a set-up to
  investigate these questions experimentally, observing that the matter wave
  field of the Bose-Einstein condensate undergoes a periodic series of
  collapses and revivals; this behaviour is directly demonstrated in the
  dynamical evolution of the multiple matter wave interference pattern. We
  attribute the oscillations to the quantized structure of the matter wave
  field and the collisions between individual atoms.%

  We study the dynamic properties of a model for wetting with two competing
  adsorbates on a planar substrate. The two species of particles have identical
  properties and repel each other. Starting with a flat interface one observes
  the formation of homogeneous droplets of the respective type separated by
  nonwet regions where the interface remains pinned. The wet phase is
  characterized by slow coarsening of competing droplets. Moreover, in 2+1
  dimensions an additional line of continuous phase transition emerges in the
  bound phase, which separates an unordered phase from an ordered one. The
  symmetry under interchange of the particle types is spontaneously broken in
  this region and finite systems exhibit two metastable states, each dominated
  by one of the species. The critical properties of this transition are
  analyzed by numeric simulations.%

  We propose a tensor network algorithm for the efficient sampling of quantum
  pure states belonging to a generalized microcanonical ensemble. The algorithm
  consists in an adaptation of the power method to a recently introduced
  ensemble of random matrix product states. The microcanonical ensemble that we
  consider is characterized by the fact that the participating energy
  eigenstates are not required to have identical statistical weight. To test
  the method we apply it to the Heisenberg model with an external magnetic
  field, and we find that the magnetization curves, due to the microcanonical
  constraint, are qualitatively different from those obtained in the canonical
  ensemble. Possible future applications include the study of isolated quantum
  systems evolving after a quantum quench.%

  We consider small subsystems of large, closed quantum systems that evolve

  of the density matrix of the subsystem in the eigenbasis of its local

  The capabilities of a new approach towards the foundations of Statistical
  Mechanics are explored. The approach is genuine quantum in the sense that
  statistical behavior is a consequence of objective quantum uncertainties due
  to entanglement and uncertainty relations. No additional randomness is added
  by hand and no assumptions about a priori probabilities are made, instead
  measure concentration results are used to justify the methods of Statistical
  Physics. The approach explains the applicability of the microcanonical and
  canonical ensemble and the tendency to equilibrate in a natural way. This
  work contains a pedagogical review of the existing literature and some new
  results. The most important of which are: i) A measure theoretic
  justification for the microcanonical ensemble. ii) Bounds on the subsystem
  equilibration time. iii) A proof that a generic weak interaction causes
  decoherence in the energy eigenbasis. iv) A proof of a quantum H-Theorem. v)
  New estimates of the average effective dimension for initial product states
  and states from the mean energy ensemble. vi) A proof that time and ensemble
  averages of observables are typically close to each other. vii) A bound on
  the fluctuations of the purity of a system coupled to a bath.%

  approximate properties of general quantum random states. The numerical

  Recent results suggest that the use of ensembles in Statistical Mechanics may
  not be necessary for isolated systems, since typically the states of the
  Hilbert space would have properties similar to the ones of the ensemble.
  Nevertheless, it is often argued that most of the states of the Hilbert space
  are non-physical and not good descriptions of realistic systems. Therefore,
  to better understand the actual power of typicality it is important to ask if
  it is also a property of a set of physically relevant states. Here we address
  this issue, studying if and how typicality emerges in the set of matrix
  product states. We show analytically that typicality occurs for the
  expectation value of subsystems' observables when the rank of the matrix
  product state scales polynomially with the size of the system with a power
  greater than two. We illustrate this result numerically and present some
  indications that typicality may appear already for a linear scaling of the
  rank of the matrix product state.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  In this paper we study nonequilibrium dynamics of one dimensional Bose gas
  from the general perspective of dynamics of integrable systems. After
  outlining and critically reviewing methods based on inverse scattering
  transform, intertwining operators, q-deformed objects, and extended dynamical
  conformal symmetry, we focus on th1206.2408v1e form-factor based approach.
  Motivated by possible applications in nonlinear quantum optics and
  experiments with ultracold atoms, we concentrate on the regime of strong
  repulsive interactions. We consider dynamical evolution starting from two
  initial states: a condensate of particles in a state with zero momentum and a
  condensate of particles in a gaussian wavepacket in real space. Combining the
  form-factor approach with the method of intertwining operator we develop a
  numerical procedure which allows explicit summation over intermediate states
  and analysis of the time evolution of non-local density-density correlation
  functions. In both cases we observe a tendency toward formation of
  crystal-like correlations at intermediate time scales.%

  Understanding relaxation processes is an important unsolved problem in many
  areas of physics. A key challenge is the scarcity of experimental tools for
  the characterization of complex transient states. We used measurements of
  full quantum mechanical probability distributions of matter-wave interference
  to study the relaxation dynamics of a coherently split one-dimensional Bose
  gas and obtained comprehensive information about the dynamical states of the
  system. After an initial rapid evolution, the full distributions reveal the
  approach toward a thermal-like steady state characterized by an effective
  temperature that is independent from the initial equilibrium temperature of
  the system before the splitting process. We conjecture that this state can be
  described through a generalized Gibbs ensemble and associate it with
  prethermalization.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  The generation, manipulation and fundamental understanding of entanglement
  lies at the very heart of quantum mechanics. Entangled particles are
  non-interacting but are described by a common wavefunction; consequently,
  individual particles are not independent of each other and their quantum
  properties are inextricably interwoven. The intriguing features of
  entanglement become particularly evident if the particles can be individually
  controlled and physically separated. However, both the experimental
  realization and characterization of entanglement become exceedingly difficult
  for systems with many particles. The main difficulty is to manipulate and
  detect the quantum state of individual particles as well as to control the
  interaction between them. So far, entanglement of four ions or five photons
  has been demonstrated experimentally. The creation of scalable multiparticle
  entanglement demands a non-exponential scaling of resources with particle
  number. Among the various kinds of entangled states, the 'W state' plays an
  important role as its entanglement is maximally persistent and robust even
  under particle loss. Such states are central as a resource in quantum
  information processing and multiparty quantum communication. Here we report
  the scalable and deterministic generation of four-, five-, six-, seven- and
  eight-particle entangled states of the W type with trapped ions. We obtain
  the maximum possible information on these states by performing full
  characterization via state tomography, using individual control and detection
  of the ions. A detailed analysis proves that the entanglement is genuine. The
  availability of such multiparticle entangled states, together with full
  information in the form of their density matrices, creates a test-bed for
  theoretical studies of multiparticle entanglement. Independently,
  'Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger' entangled states with up to six ions have been
  created and analysed in Boulder.%

  This paper addresses fundamental aspects of statistical mechanics such as the
  motivation of a classical state space with spontaneous transitions, the
  meaning of non-equilibrium in the context of thermalization, and the
  justification of these concepts from the quantum-mechanical point of view.
  After an introductory part we focus on the problem of entropy production in
  non-equilibrium systems. In particular, the generally accepted formula for
  entropy production in the environment is analyzed from a critical
  perspective. It is shown that this formula is only valid in the limit of
  separated time scales of the system's and the environmental degrees of
  freedom. Finally, we present an alternative simple proof of the fluctuation
  theorem.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  Low-dimensional systems provide beautiful examples of many-body quantum
  physics. For one-dimensional (1D) systems, the Luttinger liquid approach
  provides insight into universal properties. Much is known of the equilibrium
  state, both in the weakly and strongly interacting regimes. However, it
  remains a challenge to probe the dynamics by which this equilibrium state is
  reached. Here we present a direct experimental study of the coherence
  dynamics in both isolated and coupled degenerate 1D Bose gases. Dynamic
  splitting is used to create two 1D systems in a phase coherent state. The
  time evolution of the coherence is revealed through local phase shifts of the
  subsequently observed interference patterns. Completely isolated 1D Bose
  gases are observed to exhibit universal sub-exponential coherence decay, in
  excellent agreement with recent predictions. For two coupled 1D Bose gases,
  the coherence factor is observed to approach a non-zero equilibrium value, as
  predicted by a Bogoliubov approach. This coupled-system decay to finite
  coherence is the matter wave equivalent of phase-locking two lasers by
  injection. The non-equilibrium dynamics of superfluids has an important role
  in a wide range of physical systems, such as superconductors, quantum Hall
  systems, superfluid helium and spin systems. Our experiments studying
  coherence dynamics show that 1D Bose gases are ideally suited for
  investigating this class of phenomena.%

  Local temperature defined by a local canonical state of the respective
  subsystem, does not always exist in quantum many body systems. Here, we give
  some examples of how this breakdown of the temperature concept on small
  length scales might be observed in experiments: Measurements of magnetic
  properties of an anti-ferromagnetic spin-1 chain. We show that those magnetic
  properties are in fact strictly local. As a consequence their measurement
  reveals whether the local (reduced) state can be thermal. If it is, a
  temperature may be associated to the measurement results, while this would
  lead to inconsistencies otherwise.%

  We consider a quantum system consisting of a regular chain of elementary
  subsystems with nearest neighbor interactions and assume that the total
  system is in a canonical state with temperature $T$. We analyze under what
  condition the state factors into a product of canonical density matrices with
  respect to groups of $n$ subsystems each, and when these groups have the same
  temperature $T$. While in classical mechanics the validity of this procedure
  only depends on the size of the groups $n$, in quantum mechanics the minimum
  group size $n_{min}$ also depends on the temperature $T $! As examples, we
  apply our analysis to a harmonic chain and different types of Ising spin
  chains. We discuss various features that show up due to the characteristics
  of the models considered. For the harmonic chain, which successfully
  describes thermal properties of insulating solids, our approach gives a first
  quantitative estimate of the minimal length scale on which temperature can
  exist: This length scale is found to be constant for temperatures above the
  Debye temperature and proportional to $T^{-3}$ below.%

  We present a unifying framework to the understanding of when and how quantum
  mechanical systems become independent of their initial conditions and adapt
  macroscopic properties (like temperature) of the environment.By viewing this
  problem from an quantum information theory perspective, we are able to
  simplify it in a very natural and easy way. We first show that for any
  interaction between the system and the environment, and almost all initial
  states of the system, the question of how long the system retains memory of
  its initial conditions can be answered by studying the temporal evolution of
  just one special initial state. This special state thereby depends only on
  our knowledge of macroscopic parameters of the system. We provide a simple
  entropic inequality for this state that can be used to determine whether
  mosts states of the system have, or have not become independent of their
  initial conditions after time $t$. We discuss applications of our entropic
  criterion to thermalization times in systems with an effective light-cone and
  to quantum memories suffering depolarizing noise. We make a similar statement
  for almost all initial states of the environment, and finally provide a
  sufficient condition for which a system never thermalizes, but remains close
  to its initial state for all times.%

  By calculating correlation functions for the Lieb-Liniger model based on the
  algebraic Bethe ansatz method, we conduct a finite-size scaling analysis of
  the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) which is considered to be a
  possible mechanism of thermalization in isolated quantum systems. We find
  that the ETH in the weak sense holds in the thermodynamic limit even for an
  integrable system although it does not hold in the strong sense. Based on the
  result of the finite-size scaling analysis, we compare the contribution of
  the weak ETH to thermalization with that of yet another thermalization
  mechanism, the typicality, and show that the former gives only a logarithmic
  correction to the latter.%

  We show numerically that a finite isolated cluster of interacting spins 1/2
  exhibits a surprising non-thermal statistics when subjected to a series of
  small non-adiabatic perturbations by external magnetic field. The resulting
  occupations of energy eigenstates are significantly higher than the thermal
  ones on both the low and the high ends of the energy spectra. This behavior
  semi-quantitatively agrees with the statistics predicted for the so-called
  "quantum micro-canonical" (QMC) ensemble, which includes all possible quantum
  superpositions with a given energy expectation value. Our findings also
  indicate that the eigenstates of the perturbation operators are generically
  localized in the energy basis of the unperturbed Hamiltonian. This kind of
  localization possibly protects the thermal behavior in the macroscopic
  limit.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  The outcomes of measurements on entangled quantum systems can be nonlocally
  correlated. However, while it is easy to write down toy theories allowing
  arbitrary nonlocal correlations, those allowed in quantum mechanics are
  limited. Quantum correlations cannot, for example, violate a principle known
  as macroscopic locality, which implies that they cannot violate Tsirelson's
  bound. This work shows that there is a connection between the strength of
  nonlocal correlations in a physical theory, and the structure of the state
  spaces of individual systems. This is illustrated by a family of models in
  which local state spaces are regular polygons, where a natural analogue of a
  maximally entangled state of two systems exists. We characterize the nonlocal
  correlations obtainable from such states. The family allows us to study the
  transition between classical, quantum, and super-quantum correlations, by
  varying only the local state space. We show that the strength of nonlocal
  correlations - in particular whether the maximally entangled state violates
  Tsirelson's bound or not - depends crucially on a simple geometric property
  of the local state space, known as strong self-duality. This result is seen
  to be a special case of a general theorem, which states that a broad class of
  entangled states in probabilistic theories - including, by extension, all
  bipartite classical and quantum states - cannot violate macroscopic locality.
  Finally, our results show that there exist models which are locally almost
  indistinguishable from quantum mechanics, but can nevertheless generate
  maximally nonlocal correlations.%

  We show that the time evolution of an open quantum system, described by a
  possibly time dependent Liouvillian, can be simulated by a unitary quantum
  circuit of a size scaling polynomially in the simulation time and the size of
  the system. An immediate consequence is that dissipative quantum computing is
  no more powerful than the unitary circuit model. Our result can be seen as a
  dissipative Church-Turing theorem, since it implies that under natural
  assumptions, such as weak coupling to an environment, the dynamics of an open
  quantum system can be simulated efficiently on a quantum computer. Formally,
  we introduce a Trotter decomposition for Liouvillian dynamics and give
  explicit error bounds. This constitutes a practical tool for numerical
  simulations, e.g., using matrix-product operators. We also demonstrate that
  most quantum states cannot be prepared efficiently.%

  We provide an analysis of the correlation properties of spin and fermionic
  systems on a lattice evolving according to open system dynamics generated by
  a local primitive Liouvillian. We show that if the Liouvillian has a spectral
  gap which is independent of the system size, then the correlations between
  local observables decay exponentially as a function of the distance between
  their supports. We prove, furthermore, that if the Log-Sobolev constant is
  independent of the system size, then the system satisfies clustering of
  correlations in the mutual information - a much more stringent form of
  correlation decay. As a consequence, in the latter case we get an area law
  (with logarithmic corrections) for the mutual information. As a further
  corollary, we obtain a stability theorem for local distant perturbations. We
  also demonstrate that gapped free-fermionic systems exhibit clustering of
  correlations in the covariance and in the mutual information. We conclude
  with a discussion of the implications of these results for the classical
  simulation of open quantum systems with matrix-product operators and the
  robust dissipative preparation of topologically ordered states of lattice
  spin systems.%

  Characterizing how correlations behave in interacting lattice systems is one
  of the main aims of many-body physics. In this work, we show that for any
  locally bounded Hamiltonian on a spin lattice, there exists a critical
  temperature above which correlations in the thermal state between any two
  observables decay exponentially with the distance separating their supports.
  Our proof is based on a cluster expansion, which allows to approximate
  thermal states by matrix-product operators. We obtain a stability theorem for
  thermal quantum states against distant Hamiltonian perturbations. As a
  consequence, above the critical temperature, local expectation values can be
  computed with a cost independent of the size of the system. The stability
  theorem also provides a definition of temperature as a local quantity.%

  Using the ergodicity principle for the expectation values of several types of
  observables, we investigate the thermalization process in isolated fermionic
  systems. These are described by the two-body random ensemble, which is a
  paradigmatic model to study quantum chaos and specially the dynamical
  transition from integrability to chaos. By means of exact diagonalizations we
  analyze the relevance of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis as well as
  the influence of other factors, like the energy and structure of the initial
  state, or the dimension of the Hilbert space. We also obtain analytical
  expressions linking the degree of thermalization for a given observable with
  the so-called number of principal components for transition strengths
  originated at a given energy, with the dimensions of the whole Hilbert space
  and microcanonical energy shell, and with the correlations generated by the
  observable. As the strength of the residual interaction is increased an
  order-to-chaos transition takes place, and we show that the onset of Wigner
  spectral fluctuations, which is the standard signature of chaos, is not
  sufficient to guarantee thermalization in finite systems. When all the
  signatures of chaos are fulfilled, including the quasi complete
  delocalization of eigenfunctions, the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis is
  the mechanism responsible for the thermalization of certain types of
  observables, such as (linear combinations of) occupancies and strength
  function operators. Our results also suggest that fully chaotic systems will
  thermalize relative to most observables in the thermodynamic limit.%

  We study spectral properties and the dynamics after a quench of
  one-dimensional spinless fermions with short-range interactions and
  long-range random hopping. We show that a sufficiently fast decay of the
  hopping term promotes localization effects at finite temperature, which
  prevents thermalization even if the classical motion is chaotic. For slower
  decays, we find that thermalization does occur. However, within this model,
  the latter regime falls in an unexpected universality class, namely,
  observables exhibit a power-law (as opposed to an exponential) approach to
  their thermal expectation values.%

  We show that the conditional min-entropy Hmin(A|B) of a bipartite state
  rho_AB is directly related to the maximum achievable overlap with a maximally
  entangled state if only local actions on the B-part of rho_AB are allowed. In
  the special case where A is classical, this overlap corresponds to the
  probability of guessing A given B. In a similar vein, we connect the
  conditional max-entropy Hmax(A|B) to the maximum fidelity of rho_AB with a
  product state that is completely mixed on A. In the case where A is
  classical, this corresponds to the security of A when used as a secret key in
  the presence of an adversary holding B. Because min- and max-entropies are
  known to characterize information-processing tasks such as randomness
  extraction and state merging, our results establish a direct connection
  between these tasks and basic operational problems. For example, they imply
  that the (logarithm of the) probability of guessing A given B is a lower
  bound on the number of uniform secret bits that can be extracted from A
  relative to an adversary holding B.%

  We demonstrate the approach towards a Gibbs-like equilibrium state, with a
  common temperature and a chemical potential, of two finite metallic grains,
  prepared with a different number of noninteracting electrons, connected by a
  weak link that is susceptible to incoherent and inelastic processes. By
  developing an analytic method and by using an exact numerical approach, the
  quantum time evolution of the electrons in the metallic grains is followed.
  In the absence of decoherring and inelastic effects, equilibration is never
  reached. Introducing dephasing effects on the link only, using a dephasing
  probe, the two quantum systems equilibrate, but do not evolve towards a
  Gibbs-like state. In contrast, by mimicking inelastic interactions with a
  voltage probe, the metal pieces evolve towards a common Gibbs-like
  equilibrium state, with the probe.%

  It is a fundamental assumption of statistical mechanics that a closed system
  with many degrees of freedom ergodically samples all equal energy points in
  phase space. To understand the limits of this assumption, it is important to
  find and study systems that are not ergodic, and thus do not reach thermal
  equilibrium. A few complex systems have been proposed that are expected not
  to thermalize because their dynamics are integrable. Some nearly integrable
  systems of many particles have been studied numerically, and shown not to
  ergodically sample phase space. However, there has been no experimental
  demonstration of such a system with many degrees of freedom that does not
  approach thermal equilibrium. Here we report the preparation of
  out-of-equilibrium arrays of trapped one-dimensional (1D) Bose gases, each
  containing from 40 to 250 (87)Rb atoms, which do not noticeably equilibrate
  even after thousands of collisions. Our results are probably explainable by
  the well-known fact that a homogeneous 1D Bose gas with point-like
  collisional interactions is integrable. Until now, however, the time
  evolution of out-of-equilibrium 1D Bose gases has been a theoretically
  unsettled issue, as practical factors such as harmonic trapping and
  imperfectly point-like interactions may compromise integrability. The absence
  of damping in 1D Bose gases may lead to potential applications in force
  sensing and atom interferometry.%

  Non-integrability is often taken as a prerequisite for quantum
  thermalization. Still, a generally accepted definition of quantum
  integrability is lacking. With the basis in the driven Rabi model we discuss
  this careless usage of the term "integrability" in connection to quantum
  thermalization. The model would be classified as non-integrable according to
  the most commonly used definitions, for example, the only preserved quantity
  is the total energy. Despite this fact, a thorough analysis conjectures that
  the system will not thermalize. Thus, our findings suggest first of all (i)
  that care should be paid when linking non-integrability with thermalization,
  and secondly (ii) that the standardly used definitions for quantum
  integrability are unsatisfactory.%

  We experimentally demonstrate how thermal properties in an non-equilibrium

  one-dimensional (1D) Bose gas by coherently splitting it into two parts. By
  monitoring the phase coherence between the two parts we observe that the
  thermal correlations of a prethermalized state emerge locally in their final

  The circumstances under which a system reaches thermal equilibrium, and how
  to derive this from basic dynamical laws, has been a major question from the
  very beginning of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Despite
  considerable progress, it remains an open problem. Motivated by this issue,
  we address the more general question of equilibration. We prove, with
  virtually full generality, that reaching equilibrium is a universal property
  of quantum systems: Almost any subsystem in interaction with a large enough
  bath will reach an equilibrium state and remain close to it for almost all
  times. We also prove several general results about other aspects of
  thermalisation besides equilibration, for example, that the equilibrium state
  does not depend on the detailed micro-state of the bath.%

  It has previously been suggested that small subsystems of closed quantum
  systems thermalize under some assumptions; however, this has been rigorously
  shown so far only for systems with very weak interaction between subsystems.
  In this work, we give a rigorous analytic proof of thermalization for
  translation-invariant quantum lattice systems with finite-range interaction
  of arbitrary strength. We clarify the physical picture by showing that
  subsystems relax towards the reduction of the global Gibbs state, not the
  local Gibbs state. Moreover, we show that almost all pure states with support
  on a small energy window are locally thermal in the sense of canonical
  typicality. We derive our results from a statement on equivalence of
  ensembles generalizing earlier results by Lima, and give numerical and
  analytic finite-size bounds, relating the Ising model to the finite de
  Finetti theorem. Furthermore, we prove a weak version of the eigenstate
  thermalization hypothesis which holds regardless of the integrability of the
  model.%

  Understanding the mechanisms responsible for the equilibration of isolated
  quantum many-body systems is a long-standing open problem. In this work we
  obtain a statistical relationship between the equilibration properties of
  Hamiltonians and the complexity of their eigenvectors, provided that a
  conjecture about the incompressibility of quantum circuits holds. We quantify
  the complexity by the size of the smallest quantum circuit mapping the local
  basis onto the energy eigenbasis. Specifically, we consider the set of all
  Hamiltonians having complexity C, and show that almost all such Hamiltonians
  equilibrate if C is super-quadratic with the system size, which includes the
  fully random Hamiltonian case in the limit C to infinity, and do not
  equilibrate if C is sub-linear. We also provide a simple formula for the
  equilibration time-scale in terms of the Fourier transform of the level
  density. Our results are statistical and, therefore, do not apply to specific
  Hamiltonians. Yet, they establish a fundamental link between equilibration
  and complexity theory.%

  We study the collisional processes that can lead to thermalization in
  one-dimensional systems. For two body collisions excitations of transverse
  modes are the prerequisite for energy exchange and thermalzation. At very low
  temperatures excitations of transverse modes are exponentially suppressed,
  thermalization by two body collisions stops and the system should become
  integrable. In quantum mechanics virtual excitations of higher radial modes
  are possible. These virtually excited radial modes give rise to effective
  three-body velocity-changing collisions which lead to thermalization. We show
  that these three-body elastic interactions are suppressed by pairwise quantum
  correlations when approaching the strongly correlated regime. If the relative
  momentum $k$ is small compared to the two-body coupling constant $c$ the
  three-particle scattering state is suppressed by a factor of $(k/c)^{12}$,
  which is proportional to $\gamma ^{12}$, that is to the square of the
  three-body correlation function at zero distance in the limit of the
  Lieb-Liniger parameter $\gamma \gg 1$. This demonstrates that in one
  dimensional quantum systems it is not the freeze-out of two body collisions
  but the strong quantum correlations which ensures absence of thermalization
  on experimentally relevant time scales.%

  By means of exact diagonalization, we investigate the onset of 'eigenstate
  thermalization' and the crossover to ergodicity in a system of 1D fermions
  with increasing interaction. We show that the fluctuations in the expectation
  values of the momentum distribution from eigenstate to eigenstate decrease
  with increasing coupling strength and system size. It turns out that these
  fluctuations are proportional to the inverse participation ratio of
  eigenstates represented in the Fock basis. We demonstrate that eigenstate
  thermalization should set in even for vanishingly small perturbations in the
  thermodynamic limit.%

  Two identical finite quantum systems prepared initially at different
  temperatures, isolated from the environment, and subsequently brought into
  contact are demonstrated to relax towards Gibbs-like quasi-equilibrium states
  with a common temperature and small fluctuations around the time-averaged
  expectation values of generic observables. The temporal thermalization
  process proceeds via a chain of intermediate Gibbs-like states. We specify
  the conditions under which this scenario occurs and corroborate the quantum
  equilibration with two different models.%

  Metal alloys with tunable melting points were used to create nanowires in

  exposed to temperature above their melting points, nanowires began to break
  up into disconnected shorter nanorods due to Rayleigh instability. A wide

  We use exact diagonalization to explore the many-body localization transition
  in a random-field spin-1/2 chain. We examine the correlations within each
  many-body eigenstate, looking at all states and thus effectively working at
  infinite temperature. For weak random field the eigenstates are thermal, as
  expected in this nonlocalized, ergodic phase. For strong random field the
  eigenstates are localized, with only short-range entanglement. We roughly
  locate the localization transition and examine the probability distributions
  of the correlations, finding that this quantum phase transition at nonzero
  temperature may be showing infinite-randomness scaling.%

  This colloquium gives an overview of recent theoretical and experimental
  progress in the area of nonequilibrium dynamics of isolated quantum systems.
  We particularly focus on quantum quenches: the temporal evolution following a
  sudden or slow change of the coupling constants of the system Hamiltonian. We
  discuss several aspects of the slow dynamics in driven systems and emphasize
  the universality of such dynamics in gapless systems with specific focus on
  dynamics near continuous quantum phase transitions. We also review recent
  progress on understanding thermalization in closed systems through the
  eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and discuss relaxation in integrable
  systems. Finally we overview key experiments probing quantum dynamics in cold
  atom systems and put them in the context of our current theoretical
  understanding.%

  We propose to quantify the complexity of non-equilibrium steady state density

  level spacing distribution of their spectra. Based on extensive numerical
  studies in a variety of models, some solvable and some unsolved, we
  conjecture that integrability of density operators (e.g., existence of an
  algebraic procedure for their construction in finitely many steps) is
  signaled by a Poissonian level statistics, whereas in the generic
  non-integrable cases one finds level statistics of a Gaussian unitary
  ensemble of random matrices. Eigenvalue statistics can therefore be used as

  We study the Bose and Fermi Hubbard model in the (formal) limit of large
  coordination numbers $Z\gg1$. Via an expansion into powers of $1/Z$, we
  establish a hierarchy of correlations which facilitates an approximate
  analytical derivation of the time-evolution of the reduced density matrices
  for one and two sites etc. With this method, we study the quantum dynamics
  (starting in the ground state) after a quantum quench, i.e., after suddenly
  switching the tunneling rate $J$ from zero to a finite value, which is still
  in the Mott regime. We find that the reduced density matrices approach a
  (quasi) equilibrium state after some time. For one lattice site, this state
  can be described by a thermal state (within the accuracy of our
  approximation). However, the (quasi) equilibrium state of the reduced density
  matrices for two sites including the correlations cannot be described by a
  thermal state. Thus, real thermalization (if it occurs) should take much
  longer time. This behavior has already been observed in other scenarios and
  is sometimes called ``pre-thermalization.'' Finally, we compare our results
  to numerical simulations for finite lattices in one and two dimensions and
  find qualitative agreement.%

  An understanding of the temporal evolution of isolated many-body quantum
  systems has long been elusive. Recently, meaningful experimental studies of
  the problem have become possible, stimulating theoretical interest. In
  generic isolated systems, non-equilibrium dynamics is expected to result in
  thermalization: a relaxation to states in which the values of macroscopic
  quantities are stationary, universal with respect to widely differing initial
  conditions, and predictable using statistical mechanics. However, it is not
  obvious what feature of many-body quantum mechanics makes quantum
  thermalization possible in a sense analogous to that in which dynamical chaos
  makes classical thermalization possible. For example, dynamical chaos itself
  cannot occur in an isolated quantum system, in which the time evolution is
  linear and the spectrum is discrete. Some recent studies even suggest that
  statistical mechanics may give incorrect predictions for the outcomes of
  relaxation in such systems. Here we demonstrate that a generic isolated
  quantum many-body system does relax to a state well described by the standard
  statistical-mechanical prescription. Moreover, we show that time evolution
  itself plays a merely auxiliary role in relaxation, and that thermalization
  instead happens at the level of individual eigenstates, as first proposed by
  Deutsch and Srednicki. A striking consequence of this
  eigenstate-thermalization scenario, confirmed for our system, is that
  knowledge of a single many-body eigenstate is sufficient to compute thermal
  averages-any eigenstate in the microcanonical energy window will do, because
  they all give the same result.%

  Focusing on isolated macroscopic systems, described either in terms of a
  quantum mechanical or a classical model, our two key questions are: In how
  far does an initial ensemble (usually far from equilibrium and largely
  unknown in detail) evolve towards a stationary long-time behavior
  ("equilibration")? In how far is this steady state in agreement with the
  microcanonical ensemble as predicted by Statistical Mechanics
  ("thermalization")? In the first part of the paper, a recently developed
  quantum mechanical treatment of the problem is briefly summarized, putting
  particular emphasis on the realistic modeling of experimental measurements
  and non-equilibrium initial conditions. Within this framework, equilibration
  can be proven under very weak assumptions about those measurements and
  initial conditions, while thermalization still requires quite strong
  additional hypotheses. In the second part, an analogous approach within the
  framework of classical mechanics is developed and compared with the quantum
  case. In particular, the assumptions to guarantee classical equilibration are
  now rather strong, while thermalization then follows under relatively weak
  additional conditions.%

  In how far does an non-equilibrium initial ensemble evolve towards a
  stationary long time behavior for an isolated macroscopic quantum system? We
  demonstrate that deviations from a steady state indeed become unmeasurably
  small or exceedingly rare after initial transients have died out under the
  following conditions: The Hamilonian does not exhibit exceedingly large
  degeneracies of energy eigenvalues and energy gaps. A large number of energy
  levels is significantly populated by the initial ensemble. The system is
  observed by a measurement device with a reasonably bound working range
  compared to the resolution limit. The entire experiment, ending with the
  quantum mechanical measurement process, can only be repeated a "reasonable"
  number of times. It is argued that all these prerequisites for equilibration

  We identify and study classes of initial states in integrable quantum systems
  that, after the relaxation dynamics following a sudden quench, lead to
  near-thermal expectation values of few-body observables. In the systems
  considered here, those states are found to be insulating ground states of
  lattice hard-core boson Hamiltonians. We show that, as a suitable parameter
  in the initial Hamiltonian is changed, those states become closer to Fock
  states (products of single site states) as the outcome of the relaxation
  dynamics becomes closer to the thermal prediction. At the same time, the
  energy density approaches a Gaussian. Furthermore, the entropy associated
  with the generalized canonical and generalized grand-canonical ensembles,
  introduced to describe observables in integrable systems after relaxation,
  approaches that of the conventional canonical and grand-canonical ensembles.
  We argue that those classes of initial states are special because a control
  parameter allows one to tune the distribution of conserved quantities to
  approach the one in thermal equilibrium. This helps in understanding the

  In this work, we show how Gibbs or thermal states appear dynamically in
  closed quantum many-body systems, building on the program of dynamical
  typicality. We introduce a novel perturbation theorem for physically relevant
  weak system-bath couplings that is applicable even in the thermodynamic
  limit. We identify conditions under which thermalization happens and discuss
  the underlying physics. Based on these results, we also present a fully
  general quantum algorithm for preparing Gibbs states on a quantum computer
  with a certified runtime and error bound. This complements quantum Metropolis
  algorithms, which are expected to be efficient but have no known runtime
  estimates and only work for local Hamiltonians.%

  This thesis presents experiments probing physics in the crossover between
  Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) and BCS superconductivity using an ultracold
  gas of atomic fermions. Scattering resonances in these ultracold gases (known
  as Feshbach resonances) provide the unique ability to tune the
  fermion-fermion interactions. The work presented here pioneered the use of
  fermionic Feshbach resonances as a highly controllable and tunable system
  ideal for studying the cusp of the BCS-BEC crossover problem. Here pairs of
  fermionic atoms have some properties of diatomic molecules and some
  properties of Cooper pairs. I present studies of a normal Fermi gas at a
  Feshbach resonance and the work required to cool the gas to temperatures
  where superfluidity in the crossover is predicted. These studies culminated
  in our observation of a phase transition at the cusp of the BCS-BEC crossover
  through condensation of fermionic atom pairs. I also discuss subsequent work
  that confirmed the crossover nature of the pairs in these condensates.%

  We investigate the equilibration of an isolated macroscopic quantum system in
  the sense that deviations from a steady state become unmeasurably small for
  the overwhelming majority of times within any sufficiently large time
  interval. The main requirements are that the initial state, possibly far from
  equilibrium, exhibits a macroscopic population of at most one energy level
  and that degeneracies of energy eigenvalues and of energy gaps (differences
  of energy eigenvalues) are not of exceedingly large multiplicities. Our
  approach closely follows and extends recent works by Short and Farrelly [2012
  New J. Phys. 14 013063], in particular going beyond the realm of
  finite-dimensional systems and large effective dimensions.%

  This preprint contains the English translation of the paper "Relaxation
  dynamics of a quantum chain of harmonic oscillators", which was published by
  the author in 1980 in the Ukrainian Physical Journal. Comments describing its
  motivations, background ideas and results are presented as well. This paper
  addressed to the problem of approach to the thermal equilibrium in an
  isolated macroscopic quantum system, which was studied on the example of the
  quantum chain of weakly interacting harmonic oscillators. In the initial
  state, macroscopic energy was supplied to one oscillator (atom) in the chain.
  Subsequent evolution of the quantum state of the whole chain was determined
  due to the model integrability. The main subject of interest was the time
  evolution of the reduced density operators characterizing the quantum state
  of a particular atom. On the short time-scale, the energy perturbation
  expands along the chain with the velocity of the fastest phonon mode. On the
  long-time scale, the single-atom density operators display strong
  fluctuations around the canonical Gibbs distribution. These fluctuations are
  caused by the degeneracy of the energy level differences (presence of
  resonances) in the model of coupled harmonic oscillators. After lifting this
  degeneracy, fluctuations are suppressed providing, that the reduced density
  operator of each atom in the chain becomes very close to the Gibbs
  distribution at almost any time moment.%

  We study the onset of chaos and statistical relaxation in two isolated
  dynamical quantum systems of interacting spins-1/2, one of which is
  integrable and the other chaotic. Our approach to identifying the emergence
  of chaos is based on the level of delocalization of the eigenstates with
  respect to the energy shell, the latter being determined by the interaction
  strength between particles or quasi-particles. We also discuss how the onset
  of chaos may be anticipated by a careful analysis of the Hamiltonian
  matrices, even before diagonalization. We find that despite differences
  between the two models, their relaxation process following a quench is very
  similar and can be described analytically with a theory previously developed
  for systems with two-body random interactions. Our results imply that global
  features of statistical relaxation depend on the degree of spread of the
  eigenstates within the energy shell and may happen to both integrable and
  non-integrable systems.%

  It has recently been shown that small quantum subsystems generically
  equilibrate, in the sense that they spend most of the time close to a fixed
  equilibrium state. This relies on just two assumptions: that the state is
  spread over many different energies, and that the Hamiltonian has
  non-degenerate energy gaps. Given the same assumptions, it has also been
  shown that closed systems equilibrate with respect to realistic measurements.
  We extend these results in two important ways. First, we prove equilibration
  over a finite (rather than infinite) time-interval, allowing us to bound the
  equilibration time. Second, we weaken the non degenerate energy gaps
  condition, showing that equilibration occurs provided that no energy gap is
  hugely degenerate.%

  A central goal in condensed matter and modern atomic physics is the
  exploration of quantum phases of matter--in particular, how the universal
  characteristics of zero-temperature quantum phase transitions differ from
  those established for thermal phase transitions at non-zero temperature.
  Compared to conventional condensed matter systems, atomic gases provide a
  unique opportunity to explore quantum dynamics far from equilibrium. For
  example, gaseous spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (whose atoms have non-zero
  internal angular momentum) are quantum fluids that simultaneously realize
  superfluidity and magnetism, both of which are associated with symmetry
  breaking. Here we explore spontaneous symmetry breaking in 87Rb spinor
  condensates, rapidly quenched across a quantum phase transition to a
  ferromagnetic state. We observe the formation of spin textures, ferromagnetic
  domains and domain walls, and demonstrate phase-sensitive in situ detection
  of spin vortices. The latter are topological defects resulting from the
  symmetry breaking, containing non-zero spin current but no net mass current.%

  We unify two recent results concerning equilibration in quantum theory. We
  first generalise a proof of Reimann [PRL 101,190403 (2008)], that the
  expectation value of 'realistic' quantum observables will equilibrate under
  very general conditions, and discuss its implications for the equilibration
  of quantum systems. We then use this to re-derive an independent result of
  Linden et. al. [PRE 79, 061103 (2009)], showing that small subsystems
  generically evolve to an approximately static equilibrium state. Finally, we
  consider subspaces in which all initial states effectively equilibrate to the
  same state.%

  As the title says we want to answer the question; how and why does
  statistical mechanics work? As we know from the most used prescription of
  Gibbs we calculate the phase space averages of dynamical quantities and we
  find that these phase averages agree very well with experiments. Clearly
  actual experiments are not done on a hypothetical ensemble they are done on
  the actual system in the laboratory and these experiments take a finite
  amount of time. Thus it is usually argued that actual measurements are time
  averages and they are equal to phase averages due to ergodicity. Aim of the
  present review is to show that ergodicity is not relevant for equilibrium
  statistical mechanics (with Tolman and Landau). We will see that the solution
  of the problem is in the very peculiar nature of the macroscopic observables
  and with the very large number of the degrees of freedom involved in
  macroscopic systems as first pointed out by Khinchin. Similar arguments are
  used by Landau based upon the approximate property of "Statistical
  Independence". We review these ideas in detail and in some cases present a
  critique. We review the role of chaos (classical and quantum) where it is
  important and where it is not important. We criticise the ideas of E. T.
  Jaynes who says that the ergodic problem is conceptual one and is related to
  the very concept of ensemble itself which is a by-product of frequency theory
  of probability, and the ergodic problem becomes irrelevant when the
  probabilities of various micro-states are interpreted with Laplace-Bernoulli
  theory of Probability (Bayesian viewpoint). In the end we critically review
  various quantum approaches (quantum-statistical typicality approaches) to the
  foundations of statistical mechanics.%

  In the ongoing discussion on thermalization in closed quantum many-body
  systems, the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) has recently been
  proposed as a universal concept which attracted considerable attention. So
  far this concept is, as the name states, hypothetical. The majority of
  attempts to overcome this hypothetical character is based on exact
  diagonalization which implies for, e.g., spin systems a limitation to roughly
  15 spins. In this Letter we present an approach which pushes this limit up to
  system sizes of roughly 35 spins, thereby going significantly beyond what is
  possible with exact diagonalization. A concrete application to a Heisenberg
  spin-ladder which yields conclusive results is demonstrated.%

  We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of observables for finite

  derive a Mazur-type equality to split observables into a local and a

  identical by construction. We then demonstrate that fluctuations in the
  non-local part are, in general, responsible for thermalization irrespective

  We study how the proximity to an integrable point or to localization as one
  approaches the atomic limit, as well as the mixing of symmetries in the
  chaotic domain, may affect the onset of thermalization in finite
  one-dimensional systems. We consider systems of hard-core bosons at
  half-filling with nearest neighbor hopping and interaction, and next-nearest
  neighbor interaction. The latter breaks integrability and induces a
  ground-state superfluid to insulator transition. By full exact
  diagonalization, we study chaos indicators and few-body observables. We show
  that when different symmetry sectors are mixed, chaos indicators associated
  with the eigenvectors, contrary to those related to the eigenvalues, capture
  the onset of chaos. The results for the complexity of the eigenvectors and
  for the expectation values of few-body observables confirm the validity of
  the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in the chaotic regime, and therefore
  the occurrence of thermalization. We also study the properties of the
  off-diagonal matrix elements of few-body observables in relation to the
  transition from integrability to chaos and from chaos to localization.%

  Decoupling theorems have proven useful in various applications in the area of
  quantum information theory. This thesis builds upon preceding work by
  Fr\'{e}d\'{e}ric Dupuis [arXiv:1012.6044v1], where a general decoupling
  theorem is obtained and its implications for quantum coding theory are
  studied. At first we generalize this theorem to the case where the average is
  taken over an approximate unitary 2-design. The second part of this project
  tackles the question whether or not it is possible to decorrelate CQ-states
  with classical operations. We obtain results similar to the pivotal Leftover
  Hash Lemma. Finally we analyze the decoupling power of permutation operators
  in a fully quantum context and show a general procedure that yields
  decoupling theorems with permutations.%

  Derivation of the canonical (or Boltzmann) distribution based only on quantum
  dynamics is discussed. Consider a closed system which consists of mutually
  interacting subsystem and heat bath, and assume that the whole system is
  initially in a pure state (which can be far from equilibrium) with small
  energy fluctuation. Under the "hypothesis of equal weights for eigenstates",
  we derive the canonical distribution in the sense that, at sufficiently large
  and typical time, the (instantaneous) quantum mechanical expectation value of
  an arbitrary operator of the subsystem is almost equal to the desired
  canonical expectation value. We present a class of examples in which the
  above derivation can be rigorously established without any unproven
  hypotheses.%

  We study isolated many-body quantum systems after a quench and show that
  their dynamics depends on the interplay between the initial state and the
  Hamiltonian dictating the evolution. The systems are in the nonperturbative
  regime. The relaxation process is controlled by the width of the energy
  distribution of the initial state and may be very similar for both chaotic
  and integrable Hamiltonians. We derive an analytical expression for the
  fidelity decay, which displays excellent agreement with our numerical
  results. This decay is Gaussian and may persist until saturation. Analytical
  expressions that describe very well the initial evolution of the Shannon
  entropy and of few-body observables are also provided. The analyses are
  developed for deterministic one-dimensional systems and initial states of
  interest to current experiments with cold atoms in optical lattices.%

  The problem of how complex quantum systems eventually come to rest lies at
  the heart of statistical mechanics. The maximum entropy principle put forward
  in 1957 by E. T. Jaynes suggests what quantum states one should expect in
  equilibrium but does not hint as to how closed quantum many-body systems
  dynamically equilibrate. A number of theoretical and numerical studies
  accumulate evidence that under specific conditions quantum many-body models
  can relax to a situation that locally or with respect to certain observables
  appears as if the entire system had relaxed to a maximum entropy state. In
  this work, we report the experimental observation of the non-equilibrium
  dynamics of a density wave of ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice
  in the regime of strong correlations. Using an optical superlattice, we are
  able to prepare the system in a well-known initial state with high fidelity.
  We then follow the dynamical evolution of the system in terms of quasi-local
  densities, currents, and coherences. Numerical studies based on the
  time-dependent density-matrix renormalization group method are in an
  excellent quantitative agreement with the experimental data. For very long
  times, all three local observables show a fast relaxation to equilibrium
  values compatible with those expected for a global maximum entropy state. We
  find this relaxation of the quasi-local densities and currents to initially
  follow a power-law with an exponent being significantly larger than for free
  or hardcore bosons. For intermediate times the system fulfills the promise of
  being a dynamical quantum simulator, in that the controlled dynamics runs for
  longer times than present classical algorithms based on matrix product states
  can efficiently keep track of.%

  The question of how irreversibility can emerge as a generic phenomena when
  the underlying mechanical theory is reversible has been a long-standing
  fundamental problem for both classical and quantum mechanics. We describe a
  mechanism for the appearance of irreversibility that applies to coherent,
  isolated systems in a pure quantum state. This equilibration mechanism
  requires only an assumption of sufficiently complex internal dynamics and
  natural information-theoretic constraints arising from the infeasibility of
  collecting an astronomical amount of measurement data. Remarkably, we are
  able to prove that irreversibility can be understood as typical without
  assuming decoherence or restricting to coarse-grained observables, and hence
  occurs under distinct conditions and time-scales than those implied by the
  usual decoherence point of view. We illustrate the effect numerically in
  several model systems and prove that the effect is typical under the standard
  random-matrix conjecture for complex quantum systems.%

  We study thermalization in many-body quantum systems locally coupled to an
  external bath. It is shown that quantum chaotic systems do thermalize, that
  is, they exhibit relaxation to an invariant ergodic state which, in the bulk,
  is well approximated by the grand canonical state. Moreover, the resulting
  ergodic state in the bulk does not depend on the details of the baths. On the
  other hand, for integrable systems the invariant state does depend on the
  bath and is different from the grand canonical state.%

  We consider the problem of defining quantum integrability in systems with
  finite number of energy levels starting from commuting matrices and construct
  new general classes of such matrix models with a given number of commuting
  partners. We argue that if the matrices depend on a (real) parameter, one can
  define quantum integrability from this feature alone, leading to specific
  results such as exact solvability, Poissonian energy level statistics and to
  level crossings.%

  The generalized Gibbs ensemble has been shown to be relevant in the
  relaxation of a completely integrable system subject to a quantum quench, in
  the sense that it accurately predicts the steady values of some physical
  variables. We proceed to further question its relevance by giving the
  quenched system a second quench. The concern is whether the generalized Gibbs
  ensemble can also accurately predict the relaxed system's response to the
  second quench. Two case studies with the transverse Ising model and the
  hard-core bosons in one dimension yield an affirmative answer. The relevance
  of the generalized Gibbs ensemble in the non-equilibrium dynamics of
  integrable systems is then greatly strengthened.%

  Quantum ergordic theorem for a large class of quantum systems was proved by
  von Neumann [Z. Phys. {\bf 57}, 30 (1929)] and again by Reimann [Phys. Rev.
  Lett. {\bf 101}, 190403 (2008)] in a more practical and well-defined form.
  However, it is not clear whether the theorem applies to quantum chaotic
  systems. With the rigorous proof still elusive, we illustrate and verify this
  theorem for quantum chaotic systems with examples. Our numerical results show
  that a quantum chaotic system with an initial low-entropy state will
  dynamically relax to a high-entropy state and reach equilibrium. The quantum
  equilibrium state reached after dynamical relaxation bears a remarkable
  resemblance to the classical micro-canonical ensemble. However, the
  fluctuations around equilibrium are distinct: the quantum fluctuations are
  exponential while the classical fluctuations are Gaussian.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  We study time evolution of a subsystem's density matrix under unitary
  evolution, generated by a sufficiently complex, say quantum chaotic,
  Hamiltonian, modeled by a random matrix. We exactly calculate all coherences,
  purity and fluctuations. We show that the reduced density matrix can be
  described in terms of a noncentral correlated Wishart ensemble for which we
  are able to perform analytical calculations of the eigenvalue density. Our
  description accounts for a transition from an arbitrary initial state towards
  a random state at large times, enabling us to determine the convergence time
  after which random states are reached. We identify and describe a number of
  other interesting features, like a series of collisions between the largest
  eigenvalue and the bulk, accompanied by a phase transition in its
  distribution function.%
